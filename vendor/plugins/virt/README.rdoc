== Contributing

* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

== Examples

=== Connectivity Options
  uri = "qemu:///system"              # libvirt running locally
  uri = "qemu:/fqdn//system"          # used for QEMU+TLS connection
  uri = "qemu+ssh:/user@fqdn//system" # used for SSH connection
  uri = "qemu+tcp:/fqdn//system"      # used for non secured tcp connection

==== Establish the connection
  conn = Virt.connect(uri)

==== get the hypervisor
  host = conn.host

==== get the list of running guests
  host.running_guests

==== get the list of stopped guests
  host.defined_guests

====or a simple hash of both
  host.guests

==== create a new guest

  guest=Virt::Guest.new({:name => "test123"})
  guest.vcpu = 2
  guest.volume.size = 10 # in GB

  guest.save
  guest.start

  puts guest.mac

  guest.stop
Many more options exists, make sure checkout the api/tests

==== list of host bridges
  host.interfaces # physical interfaces
  host.networks   # virtual / NAT interfaces
