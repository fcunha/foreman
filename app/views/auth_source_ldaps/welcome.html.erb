  <h2>Authentication source configuration</h2>
  <p>
  Foreman can use an LDAP based service for user information and authentication
  <p>

  <p>
  The authentication process currently requires an LDAP provider, such as sldapd or Microsoft's Active Directory.
  </p>

  <p>
  The required details are described here
  <ul>
    <li>
    <b>Name:</b> an arbitrary identifier for this authentication provider.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Host and port:</b> the host on which the service resides and the internet port on which communication should progress.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>LDAPS:</b> whether the communication should be encrypted.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Account:</b> predefined account or a template, containing the keyword <b>$login</b>, <br/>
    which allows the login text to be preprocessed before passing to the provider.  <br/>
    For instance, if the provider is MS AD then the login name should be prepended with 'domain\'.<br/>
    A suitable entry in this case would be 'domain\$login'.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Password:</b> password (only required if a predefined account is used)
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Basedn:</b> the starting location within the LDAP directory structure for search operations.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>On-the-fly creation:</b> indicates that a user's details should be downloaded from the LDAP provider <br/>
    and a new user created within the Foreman application. If this entry is not ticked then even if the <br/>
    authentication succeeds the user cannot be logged in as they will be no user entry for this person.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Attributes:</b> are the names of the values that are downloaded from the LDAP provider to populate a Foreman user's information.<br/>
    E.G. a Foreman user's name can be derived from an Active Directory <b>sAMAccountName</b> attribute.
    </li>
  </ul>
