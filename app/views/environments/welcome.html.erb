  <h2>Environment configuration</h2>
  <p>
  If you are planning to use Foreman as an external node classifier you should provide information
  about one or more environments. This information is commonly imported from a pre-existing puppet configuration by the
  use of the <a href=http://theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/External_Nodes>Puppet classes and environment importer</a>
  <p/>

  <p>
  Environments may be manually created and only require the name of the environment to be declared.
